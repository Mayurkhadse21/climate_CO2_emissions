# 🌍 Climate CO₂ Emissions Dashboard (Power BI + Python)

This project analyzes global CO₂ emissions, population growth, and per capita emissions using publicly available data. Built using Python for preprocessing and Power BI for interactive dashboards.


## 📊 Dashboard Features

- 🌎 **Global CO₂ Emissions vs Population** (1960–2023)
- 📈 **CO₂ per Capita Trends**
- 🔝 **Top Emitters by Country**
- 📉 Insights into emission efficiency

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – Data cleaning & summarization
- **Power BI** – Visualization and dashboarding
- **GitHub** – Version control and portfolio hosting

## 🧠 Insights

- Global CO₂ emissions have risen sharply since the 1960s.
- Per capita emissions vary significantly — developed nations often have much higher values.
- Population growth doesn't always correlate directly with emissions growth.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: Synthesized data from public climate datasets (Our World in Data, World Bank-style format)
- Files:
  - `global_trend_summary.csv`
  - `countrywise_emissions_latest_year.csv`
